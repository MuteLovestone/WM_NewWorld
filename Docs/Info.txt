|                 WM: New World                            |
============================================================
WM: New World is a c# game loosly based on the WM:CPP game
although alot of things are going to be a bit different
the way the game runs will be using Mongame DesktopGL until
they update to use SDL.(will change if it doesnt break things)
The game will be more ingageing by allowing for Male and Female 
(as well as other genders) to be availible as free people and 
slaves. as well as thier will be at later stages enemy ai which
will be fight to gain control of the new land (Currently unnamed)

WM:New World will be availible to run on Mac, Linux and Windows 
through the use of Mono 4.5.ï»¿

============================================================
|               Reasons for the Conversion                 |
============================================================
WM:cpp uses c++ which (IMHO) is highly redundant.

My speciality is C# which the new version will be.

This is not a port or conversion WM:New World will be its own
game.

Currently WM:cpp requires wine to be used on systems other then
Windows (Which i do not own or use(Currently)) and will not use
for anything other then using the editor for Window forms
(Monodevelop doesn't have a windows.forms editor)
